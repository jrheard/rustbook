belatedly starting a dev diary for this

USEFUL COMMANDS:
* rustup docs // opens the rust documentation locally
* cargo doc --open // opens the documentation for all of your project's dependencies locally

so far i've written mean/median/mode and a first stab at pig latin, but my pig latin function
is really gross so i sent peter an email asking for advice on what i'm doing wrong

lost wifi connection so i'm just rereading the earlier portions of the book locally,
on chapter 2 right now

i read all this stuff a month ago and i've forgotten all of it because i didn't use any of it
so i'm glad there are exercises now! and am refreshing my memory

the docs also talk about "rust by example", which i should work through (TODO)
they say it has exercises too!

for historical record, here's the hideous pig latin function i'm asking peter about:

fn pig_latinize_word(word: &str) -> String {
    let characters: Vec<char> = word.chars().collect();
    let first_char = &characters[0];

    let mut rest = String::new();
    for character in characters[1..].iter() {
        rest.push(*character);
    }

    // dude what in the _hell_
    if vec!["a", "e", "i", "o", "u", "y"].contains(&&(first_char.to_lowercase().to_string())[..]) {
        format!("{}-{}hay", rest, first_char)
    } else {
        format!("{}-{}ay", rest, first_char)
    }
}

the bit where i check to see if a character is lowercase is just gross as hell,
and i don't like that it takes a &str and returns a String (i want it to just use one, but i don't know
which one's the right choice!), and pulling the string apart into first and rest feels kinda gross
(but i'm not sure if it's possible to improve that part).
hopefully peter has wisdom.
